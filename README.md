# Research-Project---Mount-Everest
This site is developed for my Capstone class at Western Kentucky University. The goal of this site is how we can improve the user experience in website design. I have focused on the responsive layout of the site so that the sites are fully functional in a large variety of devices with different screen sizes. Besides responsiveness, I have also added user interactivity in this site through the use of the Carousel.

The site has contents in multiple columns on devices with large screen sizes, and it will change to a single column on devices with a small screen. Similarly, the navigation links on the navigation bar will turn into the hamburger menu icon for small screen mobile devices. In addition to the features mentioned above, the external links open in a new tab, and internal links open on top of the current page. This website also has a carousel, and users can interact with the site through it. The users can play and pause the carousel images. Further, they can move the pictures left or right.

## How to check the responsiveness of this site
The responsiveness of the website can be checked using the Developer Tools in the Google Chrome browser. Right-click anywhere inside the website and then select inspect from the available options. This will take you to the developer tools where the second tool on the toolbar is the “Toggle device toolbar”. The Toggle device toolbar options will let you inspect the site in a variety of mobile devices of different screen sizes. Further, you can shrink or extend the width of the web page to check its responsiveness.

## Known errors
Please check the sites on all the available browsers and Google Chrome is a must.
Sometimes the links get disappeared or appeared vertically when transitioning between different screen sizes. Please refresh the browser to correct this issue.

sometimes the images will load slowly. Please allow some time to fully load the images.
Pause the Carousel first before you move the images left/right.
The footer on the second page won't stick to the bottom on a few devices like iPad or in landscape view.
